#### Description:
For my final project I decided to use my new found skills in learning computer 
programming to the test and learn how to develop an app using Flutter. While completing
CS50 I realised that I needed a little help structuring how to complete the problem sets,
so I decided to make a todo list app so that I can be better organised in what I need to complete.

My project is simply a todo list app where you can list tasks you need to complete and too feel 
some satisfaction cross them off and when needed clear them out to make room for more. The main files
under the 'lib' directory contain the screens that are used throughout the app, different widgets I 
needed to implement multiple times throughout the code and the models so that the app can run smoothly.

Design wise I was really just after a simple list with a pop up screen when adding a new task to the 
list. I chose that purple and dark grey because I was going for a dark mode style of app. Instead of 
the tasks just disappearing when done I implemented the list through because i enjoy that feeling of 
satisfaction when completing something.
